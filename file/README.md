# Waste Management System

An AI-powered waste management system built on the Stacks blockchain that optimizes waste collection routes and reduces disposal costs.

## Overview

This system leverages blockchain technology and AI to create an efficient, transparent, and automated waste management solution. The smart contracts handle:

- Registration and tracking of waste collection points
- Route optimization using AI algorithms
- Waste collection verification and tracking
- Cost management and optimization

## Getting Started

1. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @stacks/cli
   npm install -g clarinet
   ```

2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   clarinet new waste-management-system
   cd waste-management-system
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   clarinet test
   ```

## Smart Contracts

### waste-collection.clar
- Manages waste collection points
- Handles registration and updates
- Tracks collection history

### route-optimizer.clar
- Implements AI-powered route optimization
- Calculates efficient collection paths
- Manages collection schedules

### waste-tracking.clar
- Tracks waste types and quantities
- Manages disposal verification
- Handles cost calculations

## Testing

The project maintains a minimum of 50% test coverage. Run tests using:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper access controls
- Input validation for all public functions
- Regular security audits recommended
- Rate limiting on critical functions
